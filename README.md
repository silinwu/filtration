# filtration
These documents with .cpp and .py are used for simulating the filtration process.
testparticlefiltration.cpp could be used for the normal slurry with small particles.
testflocfiltration.cpp could be used for slurry after flocculation with big floc.
filter.cpp can be used for testing the initial filter.
All the .py documents are used for analysis the simulation.
Before using these .cpp documents, you need to download the documents named "dlvo" forked from hhucyl/dlvo,
and copy these .cpp into the dlvo.
These simulation code has not been finished yet, I still work on it and will update these codes recently.

Any questions can be sent to the Email address: wusilinhhu@126.com  or 1070195170@qq.com.

Be happy with simulation.

Cheers.
