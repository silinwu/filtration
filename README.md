# filtration
These documents with .cpp and .py are used for simulate the filtration process.
testparticlefiltration.cpp could be used for the normal slurry with small particles.
testflocfiltration.cpp could be used for slurry after flocculation with big floc.
filter.cpp can be used for test the initial filter.
All the .py documents are used for analysis the simulation.
Before use these .cpp documents, you need to download the documents named "dlvo" forked from hhucyl/dlvo,
and copy these .cpp into the dlvo.
These simulation code has not been finished, I still work on it and update these codes.

Any questions can be sent with the Email: wusilinhhu@126.com  or 1070195170@qq.com.

Be happy with simulation.
Cheers.
